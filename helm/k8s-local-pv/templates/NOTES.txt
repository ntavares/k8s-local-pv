{{- if .Values.developerMode }}
WARNING: developerMode is ON, which means the provisioner is not actively listening. This mode allows you to connect to a node and debug:

  MYNODE=pvdevsysk8s09
  kubectl -n kube-system exec -it $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods -owide | grep local-pv | awk "/$MYNODE/{print \$1;}") /k8s-local-pv

There are a few tests under the test/ folder. If you find other relevant tests, please add them there.
{{- else }}
Portavita's k8s-local-pv PersistentVolume provisioner should be active in a while.
{{- end }}

See chart's README.md for KNOWN ISSUES.
